# Song Generator

The **Song Generator** is a web application designed to create musical ideas, specifically jingles, based on user-provided study topics and target audiences. The application utilizes the **Cohere API** for natural language generation and **Streamlit** for building an intuitive web interface.

## How It Works

Before running the Song Generator, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install cohere streamlit
```

### Runing the Aplications

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Run the application using Streamlit:
```bash

```

### Using the Application

1. Access the application through its URL.

2. Provide the required information:

- * What you want to study today? (topic): Enter the topic of study for which you want to create a jingle.
- * Creativity: Adjust the creativity slider to control the level of creativity in the generated jingle. Lower values produce more predictable output, while higher values result in  more creative output.
